PROJECT NAME IS:
My Digital life-Digital Presence Analyzer

OBJECTIVE FOR THE PROJECT:
The main objective is the build the personal digital life moniter  which tracks your computer usage daily behaviour as well as productivity pattern using only the concepts which you have learnt along with some extra practical concepts to better implement this project
FEATURES OF THE TOOL:
 This tool will be able to 
1)	Scane your system folder to analyse file types sizes and activity.
2)	It allows you to log dialy habbits like mood study time intrest and many traits
3)	It will visual you trends to track your productivity and system usage
4)	To store your data log in mysql database
5)	Structured well enough like a real python project which is modular in nature.


CONCEPTS AND MODULES TO USE:
In order to perform this project fundamental of python and mysql are very much required. That being said there is the concept list for the project.
1)	Python fundamentals( control statements, functions ,modules, operators).
2)	Expection handling to handle errors during the execution.
3)	File handling to save data reports and blogs as an external file in your folder. It can be use to read and write data.
4)	Matplotlib and seaborn use to visualize the data by building pie, bar chat etc.
5)	Numpy and pandas it will be use to monitor all your analytics and structure your data so that digital and habit data can be well displayed. 
6)	Statistics to calculate all the habit features such as average study time, productivity trend line ,mood.
7)	Mysql + pymysq connection it will use to store log data fetch analytic and much more.
8)	Os and sys module in order to access directories file meta data such as file size file type, and modify type.

PROJECT BREAKDOWN:
This project contain several usefull features to track all your trades, habits in order to do that here is the breakdown of the project.
1)	System usage scanner. it scane the folders destop, folders , video etc it can be use to provide the matadata regrading file structure and can be inserted to  mysql.
2)	Daily habit logger.
It can be use to store user inputes based on there behaviour such as mood ,hours of study, hours of entertainment etc.
It can be also use to store data into mysql database.
3)	Visualization it can use to generate chats and graph using mathplotlib and seaborn and provides insides on producitivity treand moods vs study etc 
It can be use to save visualization to the asset folder.
4)	Expection handling it can be use to handle all errors such as file, folder not found , invalid input , database failure etc.

FEATURES:
Future improvement provide securite for logs data with the help of user authicantication. 
Export summary reports as a external file. 
Weekly comparision dashboards.
